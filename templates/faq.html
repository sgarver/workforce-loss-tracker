        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            The Tech Layoff Tracker is a web application that aggregates and displays information about layoffs in the technology industry.
            We collect data from official WARN Act filings and other public sources to provide accurate, up-to-date information about workforce changes at tech companies.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Where does the data come from?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            Our primary data source is the official WARN Database maintained by layoffdata.com, which aggregates WARN Act notices from all US states.
            We also monitor other public sources and allow community reporting of layoffs. All data is verified against official filings when possible.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">How often is the data updated?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            We perform automated nightly imports of the latest WARN data. The dashboard shows the last import time, and data is typically updated within 24 hours of new filings being published.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">What is the WARN Act?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            The WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) is a U.S. labor law that requires employers to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs.
            Companies with 100+ employees must give 60 days notice for plant closings affecting 50+ employees, or 60 days notice for mass layoffs affecting 500+ employees (or 33% of workforce).

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">How accurate is the data?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            We strive for accuracy by using official government filings as our primary source. However, layoffs can be complex events,
            and some information may be preliminary or subject to change. We recommend verifying critical information with official sources.
